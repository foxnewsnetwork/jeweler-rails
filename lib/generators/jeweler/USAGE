Description:
    A set of simple macros which puts jeweler into the rails generate command
    to make developing rails gems a little easier. Follow the good ol' Jeweler
    guide on making gems to make your gem. Because Jeweler requires git, make 
    sure you've already initialized your git repo in this joint.

Example:
    rails generate jeweler Thing

    This will create:
        lib/tasks/jeweler.rake
        .document
    
    This will modify:
    		Gemfile
